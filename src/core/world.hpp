   * 
   * @param pbcRepetitions The number of repetitions for everything inside
   * mastergrid in the x, y and z directions to create periodic boundary
   * conditions. The number of repetitions determines the cutoff range for the
   * demagnetization.
   * For example {2,0,1} means that, for the strayFieldKernel computation,
   * all magnets are essentially copied twice to the right, twice to the left,
   * but not in the y direction. That row is then copied once up and once down,
   * creating a 5x1x3 grid.

   * repetitions.
   * @throws std::invalid_argument Thrown when 0 in mastergrid size does not
   * correspond to a 0 in pbcRepetitions.
